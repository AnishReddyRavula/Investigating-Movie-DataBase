If you haven't done any statistical tests, do not imply any statistical conclusions. And make sure you avoid implying causation from correlation!\n",

Before exporting your report, check over it to make sure that the flow of the report is complete. You should probably remove all of the \"Tip\" quotes like this one so that the presentation is as tidy as possible. Congratulations!"
